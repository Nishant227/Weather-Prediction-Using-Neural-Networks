# Weather-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks
Machine Learning Project for classifying Weather into Stormy (1000) , Rainy(0100) , Foggy (0010) , Sunny(0001) and also predict weather features for next one year after training on 20 years data on a neural network 
This is my first Machine Learning Project.


Steps To run the project: 



1.Extract the files into a single directory ( say "MyWeatherProject" )


2.Open Octave(GUI) and go to the above directory


3.Type the following in the COMMAND WINDOW : "YearlyForecast();" (without double quotes)


4.Open the files "PredictionWeather1997.txt" to "PredictionWeather2016.txt" and compare with actual results from "Weather1997.txt" to "Weather2015.txt".
